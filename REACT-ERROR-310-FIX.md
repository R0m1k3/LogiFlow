# Fix React Error #310 - Production Issue

## Problem
React Error #310 occurs in production due to incorrect React hooks usage.
The error is: "Minified React error #310" which typically means using `React.useEffect` instead of `useEffect` or other hook import issues.

## Files Fixed

### 1. client/src/hooks/use-toast.ts
- ✅ Changed `import * as React from "react"` to `import { useState, useEffect, ReactNode } from "react"`
- ✅ Changed `React.useState` to `useState`
- ✅ Changed `React.useEffect` to `useEffect`
- ✅ Changed `React.ReactNode` to `ReactNode`

### 2. client/src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx
- ✅ Changed `import * as React from "react"` to `import { useState, useEffect } from "react"`
- ✅ Changed `React.useState` to `useState`
- ✅ Changed `React.useEffect` to `useEffect`

### 3. client/src/pages/BLReconciliation.tsx
- ✅ Added proper `useEffect` import
- ✅ Changed `React.useEffect` to `useEffect`
- ✅ Removed React.Fragment usage in JSX (this is fine as it's JSX, not hook)

## Status
All React hook usage issues have been corrected. The pagination system is now implemented with proper React hook imports that should work in production.

## Next Steps
Deploy to production and test the reconciliation page.
