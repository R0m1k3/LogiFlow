## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Focus on a clean, intuitive interface using Shadcn/ui components for consistency and accessibility. Color schemes are managed via Tailwind CSS custom variables for easy theming.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Dual system (local for production, Replit Auth for development)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **Security**: Comprehensive middleware (rate limiting, input sanitization, security headers)

### Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Development**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Production**: Standard PostgreSQL in Docker containers
- **Schema**: Centralized definition in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit

### Core Business Entities
- **Orders**: Purchase orders, supplier relationships, delivery tracking.
- **Deliveries**: Delivery tracking and status.
- **Customer Orders**: Point-of-sale management with barcode generation.
- **Suppliers**: Vendor management and order history.
- **Publicities**: Marketing campaign management and store participation.
- **DLC Products**: Management of products with limited shelf life, including status tracking and alerts.
- **Tasks**: Streamlined task management with simplified assignment and completion tracking.

### Data Flow
- **Request Flow**: Client requests via React Query, processed by Express middleware for authentication/security, then by route handlers using Drizzle ORM for database operations.
- **Authentication Flow**: Replit Auth for dev, secure username/password for production with PostgreSQL-backed sessions and role-based authorization.
- **Data Synchronization**: Real-time updates via React Query with optimistic updates and intelligent cache invalidation. Global store context filters data.

### Key Features
- **Authentication System**: Secure dual authentication system with robust password hashing and session management.
- **Multi-Store Management**: Global store context, role-based access control (admin, manager, employee, directeur), and data isolation.
- **Universal Pagination**: Reusable client-side pagination component applied across all main tabular data pages (Orders, Deliveries, Customer Orders, DlcPage, BLReconciliation, Tasks) with configurable limits per module.
- **Reconciliation Module**: For balancing and tracking financial discrepancies.
- **Permission System**: Granular permission management with 54 permissions across 12 categories, assigned to 4 roles.

## Recent Changes

### August 11, 2025 - Permissions System Overhaul & User Management Improvements

#### Hardcoded Permissions System Implementation
- **Migration from Database to Code**: Replaced flexible database-driven permissions with hardcoded permission system for better performance and control
- **New Architecture**: 
  - Created `client/src/lib/permissions.ts` and `shared/permissions.ts` with role-based module permissions
  - Implemented server-side middleware `server/permissions.ts` for route protection
  - Removed database tables: `roles`, `permissions`, `rolePermissions`, `userRoles`
  - Cleaned up storage interface and routes from old permission system
- **Permission Matrix by Module**:
  - **Dashboard**: All roles can view
  - **Calendar/Orders/Deliveries**: Admin/Directeur full access, Manager all except delete, Employee view only
  - **Reconciliation**: Admin full access, Directeur all except delete, Manager/Employee no access
  - **Publicity**: Admin full access, others view only
  - **Customer Orders**: Admin/Directeur full access, Manager all except delete, Employee view + create
  - **DLC**: Admin/Directeur full access, Manager all except delete, Employee create + view
  - **Tasks**: Admin/Directeur full access, Manager view + validate, Employee view only
- **Benefits**: Improved performance, simplified maintenance, no database queries for permission checks

### August 11, 2025 - User Management Improvements

#### User Deletion Fix
- **Issue**: Foreign key constraint errors when deleting users who created customer orders or other records
- **Root Cause**: User records were referenced by multiple tables (customer_orders, deliveries, DLC products, etc.)
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Enhanced deleteUser method with database transaction for atomicity
  - Prioritized lookup for `admin_local` (default admin) with fallback to any admin user
  - Ownership transfer of all user-created records to existing admin before deletion
  - Comprehensive handling of all foreign key relationships including role assignments
  - Graceful error handling when no admin user exists
- **Tables Handled**: customer_orders, orders, deliveries, publicities, dlcProducts, tasks, nocodbConfig, userGroups, userRoles (both userId and assignedBy), database_backups
- **Result**: Safe user deletion while preserving business data integrity

#### User Name Fields Optional in Production
- **Issue**: Inconsistent validation between user creation and editing forms for name fields
- **Root Cause**: Edit form required firstName/lastName while creation form had them as optional
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Removed required validation from edit form firstName/lastName fields
  - Updated placeholders to indicate "(optionnel)" for consistency
  - Maintained database schema where name fields are already optional
- **Result**: Name fields now consistently optional across all user management interfaces

#### User Edit Form Initialization Fix
- **Issue**: Pr√©nom/nom fields in edit form were not editable because they were initialized from wrong data source
- **Root Cause**: handleEditUser was only using the `name` field instead of `firstName`/`lastName` fields from database
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Modified handleEditUser to prioritize `firstName`/`lastName` fields from database
  - Added fallback to split `name` field if firstName/lastName are empty  
  - Fixed edit form initialization to use actual database values
- **Result**: Edit form now properly loads existing firstName/lastName values and allows editing

#### Email Field Consistency in Edit Form
- **Issue**: Email field was marked as required in edit form but optional in create form
- **Solution**: Removed `required` attribute and asterisk from email field in edit form
- **Result**: Email field now consistently optional in both create and edit forms
