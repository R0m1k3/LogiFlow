## Recent Changes

### August 11, 2025 - Permissions System Overhaul & User Management Improvements

#### Hardcoded Permissions System Implementation
- **Migration from Database to Code**: Replaced flexible database-driven permissions with hardcoded permission system for better performance and control
- **New Architecture**: 
  - Created `client/src/lib/permissions.ts` and `shared/permissions.ts` with role-based module permissions
  - Implemented server-side middleware `server/permissions.ts` for route protection
  - Removed database tables: `roles`, `permissions`, `rolePermissions`, `userRoles`
  - Cleaned up storage interface and routes from old permission system
- **Permission Matrix by Module**:
  - **Dashboard**: All roles can view
  - **Calendar/Orders/Deliveries**: Admin/Directeur full access, Manager all except delete, Employee view only
  - **Reconciliation**: Admin full access, Directeur all except delete, Manager/Employee no access
  - **Publicity**: Admin full access, others view only
  - **Customer Orders**: Admin/Directeur full access, Manager all except delete, Employee view + create
  - **DLC**: Admin/Directeur full access, Manager all except delete, Employee create + view
  - **Tasks**: Admin/Directeur full access, Manager view + validate, Employee view only
- **Benefits**: Improved performance, simplified maintenance, no database queries for permission checks

### August 11, 2025 - User Management Improvements

#### User Deletion Fix
- **Issue**: Foreign key constraint errors when deleting users who created customer orders or other records
- **Root Cause**: User records were referenced by multiple tables (customer_orders, deliveries, DLC products, etc.)
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Enhanced deleteUser method with database transaction for atomicity
  - Prioritized lookup for `admin_local` (default admin) with fallback to any admin user
  - Ownership transfer of all user-created records to existing admin before deletion
  - Comprehensive handling of all foreign key relationships including role assignments
  - Graceful error handling when no admin user exists
- **Tables Handled**: customer_orders, orders, deliveries, publicities, dlcProducts, tasks, nocodbConfig, userGroups, userRoles (both userId and assignedBy), database_backups
- **Result**: Safe user deletion while preserving business data integrity

#### User Name Fields Optional in Production
- **Issue**: Inconsistent validation between user creation and editing forms for name fields
- **Root Cause**: Edit form required firstName/lastName while creation form had them as optional
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Removed required validation from edit form firstName/lastName fields
  - Updated placeholders to indicate "(optionnel)" for consistency
  - Maintained database schema where name fields are already optional
- **Result**: Name fields now consistently optional across all user management interfaces

#### User Edit Form Initialization Fix
- **Issue**: Pr√©nom/nom fields in edit form were not editable because they were initialized from wrong data source
- **Root Cause**: handleEditUser was only using the `name` field instead of `firstName`/`lastName` fields from database
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Modified handleEditUser to prioritize `firstName`/`lastName` fields from database
  - Added fallback to split `name` field if firstName/lastName are empty  
  - Fixed edit form initialization to use actual database values
- **Result**: Edit form now properly loads existing firstName/lastName values and allows editing

#### Email Field Consistency in Edit Form
- **Issue**: Email field was marked as required in edit form but optional in create form
- **Solution**: Removed `required` attribute and asterisk from email field in edit form
- **Result**: Email field now consistently optional in both create and edit forms

#### Production Password Hashing Fix
- **Issue**: Admin password changes failed in production with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for localAuth.production
- **Root Cause**: Dynamic imports in production needed `.js` extension for compiled files
- **Solution**: Updated import paths to use `./localAuth.production.js` for production environment
- **Result**: Password hashing now works correctly in production for user updates

#### Email Constraint Fix for User Management
- **Issue**: Both user creation and editing failed with "duplicate key value violates unique constraint users_email_key" error
- **Root Cause**: PostgreSQL treats empty strings (`""`) as unique values, but multiple users with empty emails violated uniqueness constraint
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Updated both POST `/api/users` (creation) and PUT `/api/users/:id` (editing) routes to convert empty emails to `NULL`
  - Enhanced validation schemas to accept `null` values for email fields
  - Created `fix-duplicate-empty-email.sql` script to clean existing database records
  - Improved error handling and logging for better production debugging
- **Result**: Users can now be created and edited with optional email fields without constraint violations

#### Calendar Order-Delivery Synchronization Fix
- **Issue**: Orders linked to delivered deliveries were not showing proper status and dates in calendar view
- **Root Cause**: Three interconnected problems:
  1. OrderDetailModal was displaying non-existent `plannedDate` instead of `scheduledDate`/`deliveredDate`
  2. Order status was not automatically updated when delivery status changed via updateDelivery method
  3. Delivered deliveries had missing `deliveredDate` field causing "Date non disponible" display
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Enhanced OrderDetailModal to display correct dates: `deliveredDate` for delivered items, `scheduledDate` for planned ones
  - Added automatic order status synchronization in `updateDelivery` method when delivery marked as delivered
  - Created `fix-delivery-order-sync.sql` script to correct existing production data inconsistencies
  - Improved Calendar date initialization to show current month instead of hardcoded July 2025
- **Result**: Calendar now properly displays delivery dates and automatically synchronizes order statuses when deliveries are completed

### August 12, 2025 - Employee Permissions Restriction & Database Schema Download

#### Employee Role Permissions Update
- **Issue**: Employee role had excessive access to orders and deliveries modules, but needed restricted calendar access
- **Root Cause**: Permission system allowed employees full access to create orders/deliveries from calendar and sidebar navigation
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Updated `shared/permissions.ts`: Removed all permissions for employees on 'orders' and 'deliveries' modules
  - Modified `client/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`: Removed orders and deliveries menu items for employee role
  - Enhanced `client/src/pages/Calendar.tsx`: Added permission checks to hide "Nouveau" button for employees
  - Updated `client/src/components/modals/QuickCreateMenu.tsx`: Added role-based filtering for order/delivery creation options
- **Employee Access Rules**:
  - **Calendar**: View-only access, cannot create orders or deliveries
  - **Sidebar**: No access to Orders and Deliveries menu items
  - **Customer Orders & DLC**: Maintains supplier list access for creating customer orders and DLC entries
- **Result**: Employees now have appropriate restricted access while maintaining necessary supplier information for their workflows

#### Database Schema Download Feature
- **Issue**: Database schema scan results were only available in server logs, needed downloadable reports
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Created new API route `/api/debug/download-schema` for production schema downloads
  - Added comprehensive schema report generation with tables, columns, constraints, and record counts
  - Enhanced `client/src/pages/DatabaseDebug.tsx`: Added download button that appears after successful scans
  - Implemented proper file download headers with automatic filename generation
  - Added admin-only access restriction and production environment validation
- **Download Report Features**:
  - Complete database structure with column details and constraints
  - Record counts per table for data overview
  - Foreign key relationships mapping
  - Formatted text file with timestamps and user information
- **Result**: Administrators can now download comprehensive database schema reports for documentation and analysis

#### Employee Supplier Access Fix
- **Issue**: Employee role could not access supplier lists in Customer Orders and DLC modules on production server
- **Root Cause**: API route `/api/suppliers` was restricted to admin and manager roles only, excluding employees and directeurs
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Updated `/api/suppliers` GET route: Added employee and directeur role access for read operations
  - Updated `/api/suppliers` POST route: Added directeur role access for creation operations  
  - Updated `/api/suppliers` PUT route: Added directeur role access for edit operations
  - Updated `/api/suppliers` DELETE route: Restricted to admin and directeur only (removed manager access)
  - Created test script `test-employee-supplier-access.js` for production verification
- **Access Matrix Updated**:
  - **GET /api/suppliers**: admin, directeur, manager, employee (all roles can read)
  - **POST /api/suppliers**: admin, directeur, manager (creation permissions)
  - **PUT /api/suppliers**: admin, directeur, manager (edit permissions)  
  - **DELETE /api/suppliers**: admin, directeur only (delete permissions)
- **Result**: Employees can now access supplier lists in Customer Orders and DLC modules while maintaining appropriate write restrictions
